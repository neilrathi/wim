      <p>What can we draw? An artist might say `anything'â€”but my skill in that department is severely lacking. My lack of basic artistic talent means that I'm limited to whatever can be sketched with the crutch of a couple basic tools.</p>

      <p>Fortunately, I share this predicament with the brightest mathematicians of Ancient Greece. Pythagoras and Euclid had a preoccupation with the ruler and compass, tools which allow us to construct geometries of perfect precision. This was born out of an insistence that the world could be perfectly mathematically constructed. Euclid's <em>Elements</em> spell this out in the first three of his five geometric postulates:</p>
      
      <p class="postulate" data-attribution="Euclid's Postulates">
        <ol style = "margin-top:-15px">
          <li>A straight line is defined by two distinct points</li>
          <li>Any straight line can be extended infinitely</li>
          <li>A circle is defined by two distinct points (a center and a point on the circumference)</li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <p>These postulates define a 'perfect' infinite ruler (1 and 2) and a 'perfect' compass (3), forming the basis of <strong>Euclidean geometry</strong>. So then, what can Pythagoras and I draw? The Greeks were prolific constructors, with recipes to draw parallel lines, bisect angles, and regular polygons. Three problems, however, continued to stump them:</p>
      
      <ol>
        <li>Given an angle, can we construct an angle with <u>one third the measure</u>?</li>
        <li>Given a cube, can we construct a cube with <u>double the volume</u>?</li>
        <li>Given a circle, can we construct a square with <u>the same area</u>?</li>
      </ol>

      <p>We refer to these as <strong>trisecting the angle</strong>, <strong>doubling the cube</strong>, and <strong>squaring the circle</strong>. The Greeks (and other civilizations) tried endlessly to build these three constructions, convinced that they were possible. Indeed, it was not until the 19th century that we had a definite proof of their impossibility, due to Wantzel.</p>

      <p>It turns out that this impossibility is tied to the notion of algebraic fields. Effectively, our proof boils down to showing that only a certain subset of the real numbers \(\R\) can be constructed, and then showing that the solutions to the problems do not fall within this subset.</p>

      <h2>What numbers can I make?</h2>
      <p>Euclid's <em>Elements</em> give us a nice framework for algebraically examining constructability. We can draw out some arbitrary length with our straightedge; let's call this length \(1\). We can copy \(1\) with our compass, and shift this over infinitely in the cardinal directions, giving us the perpendicular \(x\)- and \(y\)-axes of the Cartesian plane.</p>

      <p>To make things slightly more formal, let's consider points \((x,y) \in \R^2\), and lets define \(K \subseteq \R^2\) as the set of <em>k</em>onstructible points. Which elements of \(\R^2\) are also elements of \(K\)? Note that if we accept the Euclidean version of a perfect straightedge and compass, we are limiting ourselves to the following five `operations' on points:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Creating a line from two distinct points</li>
        <li>Creating a circle from two distinct points</li>
        <li>Finding the intersection of two distinct lines</li>
        <li>Finding the intersection(s) of two distinct circles</li>
        <li>Finding the intersection(s) of a line and a circle</li>
      </ol>

      <p>This gives us a nice way to formulate constructibility.</p>

      <p class = "definition" data-attribution = "Geometric Formulation of Constructible Numbers">A point \(k\) is constructible if and only if it can be created with operations of a straightedge and compass.</p>

      <p>Note that we can add two lengths together by copying one with a compass and appending it onto the other with a straightedge. This allows us to construct any of the integers using \(1\) through basic addition and subtraction (more formally, this is because \(\Z\) is cyclic and generated by \(1\)). So then \(\Z \subseteq K\).</p>

      <p>If we have lengths \(a, b\) which are constructed in this way, we can then create \(a + b, a - b, a \cdot b,\) and \(a/b\). The first two can be constructed in the same way as above; we show multiplication and division geometrically here (TODO: ADD FIGURE). So then \(\mathbb{Q} \subseteq K\).</p>

      <p>If we have a length \(a\), we can use \(1\) to construct \(\sqrt{a}\) geometrically as in Figure (TODO: ADD FIGURE). This is a result of the Pythagorean theorem; if we let \(x\) be the length from the circle to diameter, we have</p>

      $$
      \begin{aligned}
          \left(\sqrt{x^2 + 1}\right)^2 + \left(\sqrt{a^2 + x^2}\right)^2 &= (a + 1)^2 \\
          x^2 + 1 + a^2 + x^2 &= a^2 + 2a + 1 \\
          2x^2 &= 2a,
      \end{aligned}
      $$

      <p>so \(x = \sqrt{a}\). So \(K\) includes all numbers which can be made from the integers with addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and square roots (note that this includes nested square roots).</p>

      <p>It turns out that this is <em>all</em> of $K$. We cannot construct, for example, irrational numbers, or cube roots of arbitrary rationals (a point that is relevant for the proofs we cover below). To see this, we can look at all possible operations of construction, starting with numbers in the subset of \(K\) we found above. If we create a line, this obviously limits us to the \((x,y) \in K\) we identified earlier. But if we create a second line that intersects this, we can describe their intersection as the solution to
      
      $$\begin{cases}
          a_0x + b_0y = c_1 \\
          a_1x + b_1y = c_2,
      \end{cases}$$

      with \(a, b, c\) rational/square roots. Of course, the solution to a system of linear equations can always be found via Gaussian elimination, which simply uses addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. That is, the intersection of any two lines with rational and square root coefficients will also always have a rational and square root closed-form expression.</p>

      <p>Alternatively, we can construct a circle (which is again limited to the subset we found above), and then draw a line that intersects this. The point of intersection here is the solution to the system
      
      $$\begin{cases}
          (x-a_0)^2 + (y-b_0)^2 = r_0^2 \\
          a_1x + b_1y = c_2.
      \end{cases}$$</p>

      <p>We can solve this through, for example, substitution:</p>

      $$
      \begin{aligned}
          \frac{1}{b_1} \left(c_2 - a_1x\right) &= y \\
          (x-a_0)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{b_1} \left(c_2 - a_1x\right)-b_0\right)^2 &= r_0^2.
      \end{aligned}
      $$

      <p>This is a quadratic in \(x\), which has solutions of the form
      $$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{a^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.$$
      But here, the coefficients \(a,b,c\) are rational/square root, meaning that \(x\) is also rational/square root. Similarly, consider the intersection of two distinct circles, which is the solution to</p>
      
      $$\begin{cases}
          (x-a_0)^2 + (y-b_0)^2 = r_0^2 \\
          (x-a_1)^2 + (y-b_1)^2 = r_1^2.
      \end{cases}$$
      
      <p>Subtracting and rearranging yields
      $$2(a_1 - a_0) \cdot x + 2(b_1 - b_0) \cdot y = a_1^2 - a_0^2 + b_1^2 - b_0^2 + r_0^2 - r_1^2$$
      which is a linear equation in \(x,y\). Then we have a system of a circle and a line, which reduces to the case above, so the solution to this system must be constructible as well.</p>

      <p>We've therefore shown that any point that all constructible numbers can be expressed in closed form through integers with addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and square roots, and all such numbers are constructible. This gives us the full formulation of \(K\).</p>

      <p class = "theorem" data-attribution = "Algebraic Formulation of Constructible Numbers">
        A number \(k\) is constructible if and only if it can be written as a combination of integers using the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and square roots.
      </p>
      
      <p>As we showed above, this also means that \(\Z \subseteq \mathbb{Q} \subseteq K\) (but \(K\) also includes irrationals, like \(\sqrt{2}\). The impossibility of trisecting the angle and doubling the cube directly follows from this algebraic characterization of \(K\), which we now show.</p>
